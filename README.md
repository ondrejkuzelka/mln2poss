Implementation of algorithms from: O. Kuzelka, J. Davis and S. Schockaert, Encoding Markov Logic Networks in Possibilistic Logic, UAI 2015. It also contains implementation of algorithms from O. Kuzelka, J. Davis and S. Schockaert, Constructing Markov Logic Networks from First-Order Default Rules, ILP 2015.

This is a library of the algorithms presented in the above mentioned papers. It also contains implementation of a MAP-inference Markov Logic engine based on cutting plane algorithm (Riedel, 2008) and pseudo-boolean optimization using the SAT4J library (http://www.sat4j.org, using a version from: http://bamboo.ow2.org/browse/SAT4J).

Examples of usage are shown in supertweety.mln2posl.examples.Examples.java.
